Over the past few months, I’ve been working with the Basys 3 board, a fantastic tool for learning FPGA design. As I navigated its features and capabilities, I realized there’s a lot that could be helpful for those just starting out.

From setting up the board to tackling the common challenges, I’ve gathered a wealth of insights that I’m excited to share. My latest blog post captures these learnings in a way that’s accessible for beginners, aiming to simplify the learning curve and inspire confidence in using the Basys 3 board.
